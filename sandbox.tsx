!!!!!!!!! for offset
fai che offset settadelle variabili --offset-x, --offset-y che settano in css left e top del grafo.
MA: disabilita la regola se il grafo ha ui-dragging o simile qualsiasi cosa metta jqui
questo risolve il problema che il grafo parte a 0,0 a prescindere dall'offset salvato in memoria senza rompere il dragging e offset salvato solo ondragend.

for crossref: fix all .father and .parent loops and U."until" or similar stuff to prevent getting the wrong model through .father chain.
data.crossref.target.model  --> other model
data.model --> current model


during first render of any modelelement trigger forceUpdate() because it will lack jqueryui-html events as html was not there.
re-enable the bug and investigate x-8400 stuff that was hapening during resize as it's happening during edge anchoring too

Reducer.suspend()
and Reducer.resume() for stuff like resizing a node

node collapsing:
    theory: edges are rendered before nodes, so it will find a node with size0 (not rendered) and assign that size during get_size.
    proof: when i change the html css size of a vertes to 20px, but i assign in console edge.end.size={w:200, h:200}
           2 actions are fired in sequence, one setting to 200 and one to 20px.
           it does not work if the node is on isResized === false because the getter cannot trigger a set in that case.

node crazy pos: when i resize a node with an edge it goes off screen?

done:

    - disabled measurable events
    - renders only model, package, classifiers
    - lazy size update
    - edge suggestions disabled except for inheritance, but manually reference added edges are allowed

 or make it so it works like this without making new lightmode views? Graohelement or defaultnode refusing to inject view and calculate jsx of features, suggestededges res is always empty

- import ecore.ecore
- view.appliableTo (node edge, edgepoint) is not working, and is missing graph, graphvertex.   view.appliableToClasses was working i think but had DModelElement targets
- on rightclick there was "reset resizing" or something, that was needed.
- default package super buggato (check in post relase notes)
- import supports only mono-package inputs (pkg is root non-array, not subpackages either)

todo post release:
- storeSize
- up/ down rightclick won't work on m1 features
- not tested but likely bug: html id duplicate if extend and ref edge with same target (don't reference a class you are extending from the same node. no idea what can happen)
- default package Ã¨ super buggato.
se trascini qualcosa in overflow, tutti gli elementi interni si spostano.
in futuro ci renderÃ  imossibile / da incubo fare scroll / pan nel grafo.

secondo me dovremmo:
1) in model view, renderizzare i package e i sottoelementi di model.$default direttamente nella vista del modello, NON renderizzando $default esplicitamente. lo saltiamo.
2) perÃ² adesso abbiamo selezionato come radice il modello invece di un package, quindi nella toolbox a sx dobbiamo istruirlo per fargli creare classi quando Ã¨ selezionato un modello, e buttargliele in model.$package

feature done:
- toolbar edgepoint
- m1 edges

bugfixes:
- edgepoint must not hide when resizing
- nodes not draggable after changing view
- many bugs on literals
- node size resetting when changing view
- edges isVertexOverlap properties was not working properly when edge was cross-package.



OLD

done
- hide edgepoint if edge is not selected / hovered
- meta-info on features to allow autogenerated structure editors
- Generic inputs (adapt input type / select according to value type)
- completed edge & edgepoint View editor (autogenerated with the 2 points above!)
- Point, Size inputs (textual version, need to do graphical one but low priority)
- measurable actions on m1 (drag, resize, update, NOT rotate)
- edge, edgepoint delay animations ( was required to fix a bug when edgepoints were hiding during resize )
- shortcuts to set values object.$featureName = value; is not valid instead of object.$featureName.values = value;
      it works with enums too setting ordinal if value is numeric, literal if value is string. can be expanded for other types.
- viewpoint highlight row when hover
- add event "onModeUpdate" to do model -> nodepos (which cannot be done in jsx because is the very root)


bugfixes:
- fix view.father log error bug.
- m1 values were trying to access .isContainment, regardless if they were references or attributes.
- fixed data.value = 1; ( the setter )
- <Input> <Textarea> optimizations / generalizations
- loop detector if some component rerenders too much often, disables "onModelChange" until the view has been updated.

untested:
- prevent action with value = proxy from firing. it was crashing super hard in reducer function during "node.x = data;" invalid measurable event.


todo:
- ghpages deploy, tell to put build in gitignore or fix pathing wiith <base href=".">
- !!! remove function.toString() implementation shown in console output
- bug: tabindex on component root won't work?? maybe add onClick ="this.focus()" in injected props? or more generic onClick={onClick(reactevent)} and put it inside component.onClick func



when select edge, select view.edge tab
when select node, select view.node tab


todo:

coerenza conflitti:
- roolback se dal server ricevi una azione con tempo precedente all'ultima azione eseguita localmente.
  il rollback procede fino alla prima azione con timestamp piÃ¹ vecchio di quella ricevuta dal server. poi riesecuzione riorinando le azioni by timestamp & user id in caso di same timestamp.
- questo implica un funzionamento completo e perfetto di undo/redo.
- in reducer, edit +=, -= actions, vengono effettivamente "eseguite", ma poi modificate in:
    (+=)    "path.to.array.INDEX = value_inserted"      OR
    (-=)    "path.to.array = [value_post_deletion]"     e il server deve riceverle solo in questa forma.

- sometimes deletion by setting undefined does not work well,
   consider replacing it with a special "delete" value with unicode chars that are unlikely to be found (like "âÂ¦dÃ«letÃªâ¤" },
   when an action is attempting to set that val, it triggers (delete object[key]) instead. and then needs to get all pointedby and pdate them if it was inside an array (indexes moved)
   or check if array with holes are iterated without undefineds ([1, empty x4, 2] in for...in but have a[1] === undefined, a[5] === 2

only first package to package or package to class edge is visible
second reference edge causes eternal loop


problema con subgraphs and edges.
start.size, refers to position and size inside a subgraph (package).
but edges are rendered at model, so
- moving package does not move containing edges
- having package not in position 0,0 makes edges inside him misplaced.

solutions:
- render edges inside topmost package
---- problem: how to handle cross-package refs?
---- restrictions on edge z-index as the start and end location have different stacking contexts. (unfixable)

- render edge paths with htmlSize (way to go? hard but all fixable) or use outernmostSize
---- problem: resizing graph tab does not update edge positions
---- problem: moving a package does not update edges
-------- solution: on package move, get all deges starting or ending in his sueleements and update them


- when dragging class vertex node inside a package, then asking his size on console returns x:0, y:0 and resets his position
- field size inside package is wrong when package is not in coords 0,0 position is relative to outer graph instead of graphvertex
- subpackage broken cannot drag or display subelements, but adds them (visible from tree view)
